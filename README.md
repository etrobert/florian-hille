## Design

Design is done on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/2YS6lloZo7K98rXxIU9oGc/Flo?node-id=0%3A1).

## Ideas

- Custom cursor

- Calendrier ~~-> "Timeline"~~ -> "Dates"

- Media Kit -> ?
  Should include a Biographie for Programmes 'programme-biog'
  and some select pictures

Eventually the music could already be playing in the background with interaction (soundwaves...).
It should be clear that it is muted.
You should have a call to action to unmute.

Interactive elements on the page (short and discreet).

Section with social networks (with words instead of icons? see https://carlnielsencompetition.com/stories)

Parallax?

## Navbar

On landing page, classic (at top right?)
then when scrolling either sticky or disappears and a side nav like http://www.aurasens.com/ appears.

## Music Bar

Section where there are multiple recording that can be played, maybe like <https://www.alexandergadjiev.com/en/#calendar> ( scroll to Media). Like squared recording covers.
